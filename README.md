# Docker build for DESeq2

See [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) for the build details.

This build also includes `tidyverse` and `plyranges` for data preprocessing and `jupyter` for running DESeq2 from within a Jupyter notebook.

The commit tag and the package tag are set to be the same as the software version.
